WebMD is scary. You search some vague symptoms and it shows you might have cancer or some super rare disease.

Why not scare yourself medically by using peer-reveiwed research?!
With this tool, you can find all clinically relevant publications associated with whatever vague symptoms you are searching.


Your query is searched on [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) and all the search results are parsed for publication associated with whatever genetic variant ClinVar thinks is related to your vague symptoms.
